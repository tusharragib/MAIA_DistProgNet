#MAIA_DistProgNet

This repository contains my Distributed Programing and Networking class project, "An online platform to consult with Ophthalmologists, Optometrists, and Opticians." from the second semester of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications at the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio in Italy.

My colleague Ms. Marya Ryspayeva, Mr. Ebaneo Enrique Valdez Kao and I accomplished this project as a group activity.
